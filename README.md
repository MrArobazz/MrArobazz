### ⚡ Fun fact

I discovered programming and everything that goes with it after a year in Mathematics License wishing to become a Maths teacher.
But I didn't get hooked on what math was becoming at university and I wanted to go into something else!
I had never taken the time to take an interest in programming and now I really like it!
